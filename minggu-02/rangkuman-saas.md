What is the difference between IaaS, SaaS, and Paas?

In a nutshell, IaaS provides access to resources such as virtual machines and virtual storage,PaaS provides execution environments,
application development, and deployment tools, and SaaS provides software as a service to end-users.

SAAS (Software as a Service) Platform Architecture

Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. 
With this model, a single version of the application, with a single configuration is used for all customers.
The application is installed on multiple machines to support scalability (called horizontal scaling). In some cases,
a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre-release versions of the applications for testing purposes.
In this traditional model, each version of the application is based on a unique code. Although an exception , some SaaS solutions do not use multitenancy, 
to cost-effectively manage a large number of customers in place. 

SaaS (Software as a Service) Platform itecture

SaaS is a way to deliver software, the provider of the software centrally hosts one or more applications and makes them available to customers over the internet.
SaaS architecture is also one of the main pillars of cloud computing. 
An explosion in Cloud computing, driven by cloud service providers such as Microsoft with Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle, and IBM,
has seen the growth in other products and services being delivered over the internet. This includes the following SaaS models:
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Platform as a Service
- Machine Learning as a Service
- …and much more!
