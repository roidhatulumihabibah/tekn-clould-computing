What is the difference between IaaS, SaaS, and Paas?

In a nutshell, IaaS provides access to resources such as virtual machines and virtual storage,PaaS provides execution environments,
application development, and deployment tools, and SaaS provides software as a service to end-users.

SAAS (Software as a Service) Platform Architecture

Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. 
With this model, a single version of the application, with a single configuration is used for all customers.
The application is installed on multiple machines to support scalability (called horizontal scaling). In some cases,
a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre-release versions of the applications for testing purposes.
In this traditional model, each version of the application is based on a unique code. Although an exception , some SaaS solutions do not use multitenancy, 
to cost-effectively manage a large number of customers in place. 

SaaS (Software as a Service) Platform itecture

SaaS is a way to deliver software, the provider of the software centrally hosts one or more applications and makes them available to customers over the internet.
SaaS architecture is also one of the main pillars of cloud computing. 
An explosion in Cloud computing, driven by cloud service providers such as Microsoft with Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle, and IBM,
has seen the growth in other products and services being delivered over the internet. This includes the following SaaS models:
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Platform as a Service
- Machine Learning as a Service
- …and much more!

How to build a cloud-based SaaS Application

Build for the cloud
When building a (global) SaaS application chances are high that you’re building it in the cloud.
The cloud has a lot of advantages – think of scalability – in contrast to local server environments.
How to get started on your SaaS application?
Which programming language, which database, which software tools should you choose? There are many questions which need to be answered.
Therefore I’m trying to focus on the most important things.
So, first things first.
Which programming language?
Building a product for the cloud means building a product with a modern programming language.
esides personal abilities and skills, the choice of your programming language will be influenced by the possibilities of each language.
There are various (modern) programming languages out there making it a hard time to choose the right one.
